Billards codes:

...VI.py: file with VI without Lagrange multiplier (code runs but particle does not see wall).

...VIlam.py: file with VI with Lagrange multiplier and all KKT-equations explicit (code runs but particle does not see wall).

....py: Burman solution with soft wall. Works when dt and softness are tuned such that "particle can turn around smoothly with resolved time stepping near the wall"
